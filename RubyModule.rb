# A Module is a collection of methods, constants, and class variables. Modules are defined as a class, but with the module keyword not with class keyword.

# Important Points about Modules:

# You cannot inherit modules or you canâ€™t create a subclass of a module.
# Objects cannot be created from a module.
# Modules are used as namespaces and as mixins.
# All the classes are modules, but all the modules are not classes.
# The class can use namespaces, but they cannot use mixins like modules.
# The name of a module must start with a capital letter.



# module Module_name

#     # statements to be executed
 
#  end


# module Person

#     Hello = 87
#      def Person.name
#         puts "my name is anshuman"
#      end
#     end
# puts Person::Hello

#     puts Person.name
